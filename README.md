# Burger Factory
This is an online street food restaurant website, which design is adapted for devices with any screen sizes. 
By clicking on any button in the navigation menu, there is a smooth scroll to the corresponding section. 
In the "Ingredients" section, there are cards with ingredients used to make burgers. 
All ingredients can be viewed using horizontal scrolling. The "Burgers" section contains cards with types of burgers. 
When clicking on the "Details" button on each card, additional dish description expands. 
Clicking the button again collapses the description. Technologies used: HTML, CSS, CSS Flexbox, GRID Layout, JavaScript.
The project was built and minified using Gulp.
